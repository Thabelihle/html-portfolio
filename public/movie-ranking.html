<h1>The best movies according to Lungelo</h1>

<h2>My favourite recent movies</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Dune</h3>
<p>This is my favourite sci-fi movie. The cinematography, the soundtracks, the story (was a bit confusing at first)...<br />
    really sensational.
</p>

<h3>Endgame</h3>
<p>There is not much to say really... a calmination of 23 MCU movies produced such a blockbuster.</p>

<h3>Parasite</h3>
<p>What a thriller. Beautifully produced! But also really thought provoking, complex with a lot depth.</p>
